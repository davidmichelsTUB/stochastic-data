# Stochastic Data

## Introduction
In this project we go through generating synthetic time series data based on real data. We work through selecting which time series to use, preparing it for information extraction and the generation process of synthetic data.

## Features
- `datageneration.ipynb`: Generates synthetic data from a chosen time series dataset.
 - `preprocessing.ipynb`: Shows the process behind preprocessing data and selecting a time series dataset as baseline for synthetic data.

## Installation
Instructions on how to install and set up the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidmichelsTUB/stochastic-data
cd stochastic-data
```

## Usage
This section explains how to use the project with examples.

### Data Generation
`datageneration.ipynb` provides scripts for generating synthetic data. To use this notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook datageneration.ipynb
```

### Data Preprocessing
`preprocessing.ipynb` contains tools for data selection, visualisation, and feature selection. To use this notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook preprocessing.ipynb
```
